      Hello, my name is Gina and I am currently living in Los Angeles, California. I graduated from UC San Diego with a
      degree in Communications and minor in Law and Society, with a focus in Digital Marketing.<br>
      While pursuing my career in Marketing, I realized that I really enjoyed the creative aspects of my job,
      specifically digital media. I further explored digital media and graphic design, and it somehow led me to dabble
      around in coding/web development.<br>
      I have taken multiple classes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through different resources (more familiar with HTML
      and CSS) and loved it. It was fascinating to see the code I write come to life. I have always been eager to learn
      more and can't wait to take on this new journey of web development and build upon my current skills and
      experiences!</p>
